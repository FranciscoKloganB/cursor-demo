## Prerequisites

- ASDF
- Docker
- Encore CLI
- Revive
- Taskfile

A set of commands to install the expected tools is provided below. It assumes
you are on MacOS, have access to Homebrew and utilize ZSH. Your mileage will
vary if you are on a different Operating System or use a differen command line
interpreter implementation (e.g., Bash, Elvish, Fish).

  ```bash
  brew install coreutils curl git asdf docker docker-compose encoredev/tap/encore go-task mockery revive sqlc ;

  echo -e "\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/libexec/asdf.sh" >> ${ZDOTDIR:-~}/.zshrc ;

  asdf plugin add golang https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-golang.git ;
  asdf install golang ;
  ```

## Running the project

You can launch the entire company stack using docker containers with a single
command:

```bash
task serve
```

While `task serve` (alias to `encore run`) process is running, open
[http://localhost:9400/](http://localhost:9400/) to access Encore's
[developer dashboard](https://encore.dev/docs/go/observability/dev-dash).

Here you can see traces for all requests that you made while using the frontend,
see your architecture diagram, and view API documentation in the Service Catalog.

## Running other development and CI tasks

To list all available project tasks and their descriptions run:

```bash
task --list
```

## Encore

### Deploying to self-hosted infrastructure

See the [self-hosting instructions](https://encore.dev/docs/go/self-host/docker-build)
for how to use `encore build docker` to create a Docker image and configure it.

### Deploying with Encore Cloud Platform

Deploy your application to a free staging environment in Encore's development cloud using `git push encore`:

```bash
git add -A .
git commit -m 'Commit message'
git push encore
```

You can also open your app in the [Cloud Dashboard](https://app.encore.dev) to
integrate with GitHub, or connect your AWS/GCP account, enabling Encore to
automatically handle cloud deployments for you.

#### Linking the application to GitHub

Follow these steps to link your app to GitHub:

1. Create a GitHub repo, commit and push the app.
2. Open your app in the [Cloud Dashboard](https://app.encore.dev).
3. Go to **Settings âž” GitHub** and click on **Link app to GitHub** to link your
app to GitHub and select the repo you just created.
4. To configure Encore to automatically trigger deploys when you push to a
specific branch name, go to the **Overview** page for your intended environment.
Click on **Settings** and then in the section **Branch Push** configure the
**Branch name** and hit **Save**.
5. Commit and push a change to GitHub to trigger a deploy.
